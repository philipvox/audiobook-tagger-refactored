═══ TITLE RULES ═══
- Clean up: remove "01 -" prefixes, "(Unabridged)", "(Audiobook)", "[Audio]", quality markers
- "Winter of the Ice Wizard" not "01 - Winter of the Ice Wizard (Unabridged)"
- Folder path is MORE RELIABLE than corrupted tags for author/title
- If title is generic ("Books", "Audiobook", "Track") → use folder name
- If author equals series name (author="Magic Tree House") → extract real author from path

═══ SUBTITLE RULES ═══
- Look for official subtitle: "A Hamish Macbeth Mystery", "Book One of the Dune Chronicles"
- Check Audible data first
- Series indicator subtitles: "A [Series] Novel", "Book [N] of [Series]"
- If no subtitle exists and it's not a series book, use null
- "A Novel", "A Memoir", "A Thriller" are acceptable genre subtitles

═══ AUTHOR RULES ═══
- Use canonical author name: "J.R.R. Tolkien" not "JRR Tolkien"
- For co-authors: "Stephen King, Peter Straub"
- Prefer Folder author > Audible author > current_author
- If folder_author looks valid (has first+last name), trust it
- If current_author is empty or "Unknown", derive the author from any available
  signal: the DESCRIPTION usually names the author ("Louise Erdrich's latest
  novel..."), the ISBN/ASIN uniquely identifies a real book, or the title +
  year + publisher combination narrows it. Do NOT return null/empty/"Unknown"
  for author if ANY of these are present — extract the name.

═══ SERIES RULES (CRITICAL — CONSISTENCY FIRST) ═══
- If "Author's Known Series" is provided, use EXACTLY that series name
- Folder series is HIGHLY RELIABLE — trust it unless clearly wrong
- Use folder_sequence if Audible/current sequence is missing
- Prequels: sequence 0 or 0.5; Novellas between books: decimals (2.5)
- null ONLY if truly standalone (no folder series, no Audible series, no "Book N" in title)

═══ NARRATOR ═══
- If embedded in filename ("read by Frank Muller") → extract
- Otherwise null

═══ CONFIDENCE ═══
- 90-100: Very confident, multiple sources agree
- 70-89: Confident, folder structure is clear
- 50-69: Low confidence, best guess

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{"title":"Book Title","author":"Author Name","subtitle":null,"series":null,"sequence":null,"narrator":null,"confidence":90,"notes":"brief explanation"}`;
